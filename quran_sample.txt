Quran 41:34 — The good deed and the bad deed are not equal. Repel [evil] by that [deed] which is better; and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmity [will become] as though he was a devoted friend.

Quran 3:134 — Those who spend [in the cause of Allah] during ease and hardship and who restrain anger and who pardon the people — and Allah loves the doers of good.

Quran 24:22 — Let them pardon and overlook. Would you not like that Allah should forgive you?

Quran 16:126 — And if you retaliate, then retaliate with an equivalent of that with which you were harmed. But if you are patient — it is better for those who are patient.

Quran 42:43 — And whoever is patient and forgives — indeed, that is of the matters [worthy] of resolve.
